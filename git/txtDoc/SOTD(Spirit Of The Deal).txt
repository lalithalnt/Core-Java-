now if we goto MDM
http://mdmui-cstg.cloudapps.cisco.com/mdmui/rest/proxyHome
Proxy User: duabhish

only NS deals will be visible,it will be either of dealType=2 or dealType=5
This is where we can directly approve it
This option will be there only if we login as "Abhishek Dube(duabhish)
he is super user

we can have options like 
1.edit deal
2.executive summary
3.If we clicl on dealId we can have more Information,it will show "scenario browser"
In CCW we have quotes(Quote Number) for the deal,the same way in MDM for a deal we will have scenarios

what evr the quote we create in backend the values in cq_quote and cq_quote_line they copy it into MDM tables,
they are called cq_scenario and cq_scenario_line.so that quote become a scenario

In muti-quote scenario only one should be published.so the main scenario will be we have to check this i.e.,

Recommended Quote should be "true"
published should be "published"
