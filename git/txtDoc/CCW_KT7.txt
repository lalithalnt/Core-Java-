Creating order

---partner login with direct or proxy url
---But when creating order we need to access direct URL
---Using partner login create a quote
---After submitting quote if buy method is cisco i.e., 1-tier we can create an order using parner login with username and pwd in direct url
	or if buy method is "disti" i.e., 2-tier we can create an order using disti login with username and pwd in direct url

---Another way we can login as AM in SFDC and create opportunity
---partner should be required 
---if buy method is cisco i.e., 1-tier we can create an order using parner login with username and pwd in direct url
	or if buy method is "disti" i.e., 2-tier we can create an order using disti login with username and pwd in direct url
