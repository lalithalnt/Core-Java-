CCW Quoting Day1 KT1

1.CCW -cisco commerce workspace
--Its like a web portal to order cisco products(like Amazon)
--End customers can't do it
--only internal users i.e., specific users can login and order it

2.Quoting
--Internal user will create a quote and there will be some base discount on those products
if End-Customer comes and asks us a cisco product.he can order on top of that quote
--quote mainly contains a product
--They are called SKU's or items and in technical terms we call it as "Quote Lines"
--In CCW quote is a part of CCW
--There are many modules in CCW.They are
	a.quoting
	b.ordering
	c.Configuration
	(config team will take care of configuring the items for a particular product)
	(pricing team will take care about the discounts,list price etc whenevr we try to add item
	
--unit list price---ex:a mobile with MRP price(10,000)---"Unit List Price is 10,000/-"
--Extended List price--10 mobiles*List price(10*10,000)=1,00,000---"Extended List Price is 1,00,000/-"
--If we apply some base discount on that product then calculate that product price with discount--that is called "Unit Net Price"
and "Extended Net Price" also same like that
*unit list price is just for 1 quantity
*extended list price is for all 10 units
--So flow will be like "Quoting--Config--order
		config and pricing--we will get inforamtion about items and prices form config and pricing
		quoting-from quoting we create an order(based on this quoting we create an order)

Loggin as sunchand/ cisco123 (Username/ pwd)
Proxy as “smadick”--partner

There are some fixed users who are authorized to login into CCW.They are 3 types of users
1.Partner
2.Distributor(disti)	
3.Re-sellers

1-tier flow:
cisco-->partner(middleman)-->End-Customer================= "1-tier flow" ---quote will be fulfilled by "cisco"---cisco fullfillment
--partner gets items from cisco and sells the product to End-Customer
--later partner sends invoice to cisco i.e watevr billing is there from End-Customer partner will sends it to cisco
--cisco will not be involved in billing and all
--since we have one middleman here its called "1-tier flow"
2-tier flow:
cisco-->Disti-->Partner-->End-Customer==============  "2-tier flow"--quote will be fulfilled by "disti"--disti fullfillment
--cisco can't have warehouses everywhere so distributors will have warehouses,they will buy products from cisco and stock them in
warehouses
--And the partners,not only from cisco but they can buy products from distis also 

3.Re-sellers:
Cisco-->Disti-->Re-sellers-->End-Customer==========="2-tier flow"
--there is no much difference between partner and reseller,the only thing is reseller can't directly buy product from cisco
--bcoz resellers will have small shops they directly sell products to end-customers
--where cisco cant directly can't reach out to end-customers 

Note:

--when comes to partner,there are 2 ways
1.when partner buys product from cisco it is "1-tier flow"
2.when partner buys product from disti it is "2-tier flow"

====================
Creating the quotes
=====================
1.partner can create the quote either by 1-tier flow or 2-tier flow
2.disti can create the quote but when disti creates quote he has to mention the partner bcoz he cant sell the product directly to end-customers
so agin it is "2-tier flow"
3.There is another type of user called "AM(Account Manager)"
	--these partners,distis,reseelres are all not part of cisco
	--but these AM's are cisco employees(cisco team),they can also create quotes and sell directly to end-customers(again it is "1-tier flow")
	--but the main difference is that they have more previlages and more functions that are enable for AM's
	
	
=============
In CCW
=============
--Another terminology that we use in CCW is "Deals And Quotes"	
--Deal is a wrapper around the quote

		--suppose we are introducing a product into a particular region,
		--to promote that product in that region only, we will give some incentives and special discounts for that region only
		--so if u want to have that special discouts in that particular region only,we create a Deal
		--there will be 2 to 3 pages extra before quote creation
		--Its like a wrapper.there is no difference between deal and quote
		--incentives and questionaire will not be there for quote(for deal it will be there)
		--partner if it is 2-tier(i.e using disti)cant able to determine the price.so distributor must determine the price i.e., the one (partner)
		who is creating the quote will not be able to pay it
		---this is basically a "Re-seller"
		---so disti has to login into CCW and add the discounts and determine the price
